WEEK 6 ANSWERS
Assess your Course 5 end-of-course project
This is the rubric for the Course 5 end-of-course project. You will use this rubric to review and grade your own work. The rubric grading process is an important part of the learning experience because it allows you to objectively assess your end-of-course project against a set of criteria.

There are a total of 20 points for the end-of-course project and 20 items in this rubric. Each rubric item is worth 1 point. The items are grouped by topic and correspond to each step you completed for the Course 5 end-of-course project. 

To use the rubric, first open your end-of-course project notebook, executive summary, and PACE strategy document. Next, review each rubric item’s grading criteria. Then respond to each statement by marking “yes” or “no.” 

When you complete and submit the rubric, you will receive a percentage score. This score will help you confirm whether you completed the required steps of the end-of-course project; the recommended passing grade for this project is 80% (or 16/20 points). If you want to increase your score, you can revise your project and then resubmit this rubric to reflect any changes you make. Try to achieve at least 16 points on this rubric before continuing on to the next course.
